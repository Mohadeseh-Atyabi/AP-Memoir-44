44 Memoir is a strategy game in which a series of World War II operations are simulated. Operations such as the occupation of the Pegasus Bridge by British forces or the liberation of Paris. In each scenario, one of the players is in the role of Axis and the other is in the role of Allied, and both players must try to fulfill the winning conditions of that scenario. 

Now, what we do in this project is to implement a scenario of the game. The way of the game is that in each round, a number of cards and forces are given to the players and the players execute the mechanism in each turn.
